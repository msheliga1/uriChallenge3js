## Project Goals
In summary this repo will use javascript to create an interactive password generator. 
==============================================================================================================================   
Github:  
    Create Repo (github, repositories => New)
    Clone to local machine (Copy https, then git clone paste) 
    Create a nice long READ.md file!!  (Modify prior projects.)
    Copy sample files from prior project (or create from scratch) (Very confusing instructions for project 3. Why not fork?)
    -- Go to Demo (root) folder, download zip, moving to local repo, unzipping likely fastest method.     
    -- Could not find a quicker way to copy over all files.    
    ... create HTML and CSS ...  
    Commit and push files back to gitHub  
    Deploy code (Settings ... GitHub Pages->main)
    Make Sure it Works  
    Insert Screenshot of deployment into readme file.
  
HTML:   
    View the Acceptance Criteria. 
    Create/Modify HTML and CSS.   
  
    click the button to generate a password - presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
    prompted for password criteria - select which criteria to include in the password
    prompted for the length of the password - choose 8 characters to 128 characters
    asked for character types to include in the password - confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special chars
    I answer each prompt - input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
    All prompts are answered - a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
    The password is generated - and is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
